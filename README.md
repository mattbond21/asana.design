## Dependencies

- Ruby 2.4 (easily installed by rbenv)
- Jekyll 3.5
- git

## Commands and Hosting
Run `bundle exec jekyll serve --baseurl '/'` to develop locally.

The `master` branch is being deployed to ![](https://asana.design)

When making changes or contributions, create a branch from `develop` and make sure it is functioning well locally (in multiple browsers) before you create a pull request from `develop` to `master`. Once you merge the PR to `master` the changes will be live almost immediately.
